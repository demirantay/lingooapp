# Domingo's Documentation

Hello maintainers! this documentation is written just for you once we have a public documentation for our API we will share it in a different file. This documentation is just for the source code's maintainers.

### Overview

This documentation is structured into two departments. One department keeps a simple changelog about the features that are added to the site and they are chronologically ordered by their version numbers.

The second department is the important part! It is where we keep the logic and the code of our applications models. You might ask why just models? It is because they are the main classes that we should document religiously. They make up the backbone logic of the app and provide the data structures that we need. Everything else is just an manipulation of those data structures with various algorithms.

### FAQ

Q: Why is this documentation is so simple?<br>
A: Because at the moment I am a single developer. So writing loads of documentation will just slow down the project. However, I also wanted to keep an clean documentation for a single developer. I will expand on this documentation later on.

Q: What is the archive/ folder for?<br>
A: Archive folder holds the old documentation system which was not good at all. I keep the old documentation files inside it, because deleting them and having them anymore could be harmful in the long run.<br>
