# `Version 1.6.0`

## Design Summary

(From now on untill I figure out a good way to write the documentation with a really good archiving system I am going to write them like below, short, precise and descriptive)

In this update I didn't add any new features or applications. I just redid the design of the profile feature. Yes, I have added new models, views ... etc. and changed a lot of the unerlying logic that is connected to the profile section.

However as I said this whole update was solely done to re-design and code the profile feature.

- I added a new profile info card
- I added a new course listings on the right side of the profile (course listings are the courses that the profile owner is enrolled in)
- I added a course progress display box where the user can see their progress, xp, level ... etc. of the coure they are enrolled in.
- And finally I added a new lesson track box where the application tracks the statistics of the lessons you have done throughout the year.

Plus, I added a small box in the home section that links to my patreon page.
